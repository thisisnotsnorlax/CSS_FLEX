The CSS provided applies Flexbox to create a responsive layout for profile cards. The .profile-container uses display: flex with 
flex-wrap: wrap, allowing cards to wrap and maintain alignment. justify-content: center ensures the cards are centered horizontally,
while gap: 20px manages the spacing between them. Each .profile-card has consistent padding and uses hover effects to improve user 
interaction. Flexbox simplifies the alignment and distribution of elements, making the layout adaptive across different screen sizes.

NOTE: THE DESIGN OR TEMPLATE IS FROM https://supersimple.dev/exercises/youtube INCLUDING THE IMAGES,
      BUT I DIDN'T COPY THE CODE. I CODE IT ON MY OWN WAY.

Here I use flex to make the thumbnails right next to each other and I used flex as well for the links.
